        <h2>Plan and Document Testing</h2>
        <p>Create a formal testing plan that outlines objectives, strategies, and goals.
            Clear documentation ensures effective communication among team members.
            Set SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) goals.</p>

        <h2>Automate Testing Where Possible</h2>
        <p>Use automated testing tools for repetitive tasks.
            Automated tests provide consistency, speed, and reliability.
            Focus manual testing efforts on exploratory and edge cases.</p>

        <h2>Test Early and Often</h2>
        <p>Integrate testing into the development process from the beginning.
            Catch defects early to reduce rework and improve overall efficiency.
            Continuous integration and continuous testing are essential.</p>

        <h2>Security Testing Is Crucial</h2>
        <p>Regularly assess your software for vulnerabilities.
            Perform penetration testing, code reviews, and security scans.
            Protect against common threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and authentication flaws.</p>

        <h2>Usability Testing Matters</h2>
        <p>Evaluate the user experience beyond functional correctness.
            Test navigation, layout, and overall usability.
            Involve real users to gather feedback and improve usability.</p>
