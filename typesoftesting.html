        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>Focuses on individual components (methods or functions) of the software.
            Validates that each unit performs correctly in isolation.
            Generally automated and runs quickly.
            Essential for catching bugs early.</p>

        <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
        <p>Verifies that different modules or services work well together.
            Ensures seamless communication between components.
            Detects issues related to data flow, APIs, and dependencies.</p>

        <h2>Functional Testing</h2>
        <p>Evaluates the software’s functionality against specified requirements.
            Emulates real-world scenarios to validate business logic.
            Includes positive and negative test cases.</p>

        <h2>Acceptance Testing</h2>
        <p>Determines whether the software meets user expectations.
            Conducted by end-users or stakeholders.
            Validates the overall system behavior.</p>

        <h2>Regression Testing</h2>
        <p>Ensures that new changes do not break existing functionality.
            Re-runs existing test cases after code modifications.
            Crucial for maintaining software stability.</p>

        <h2>Performance Testing</h2>
        <p>Assesses system performance under various conditions (load, stress, scalability)...</p>

        <h2>Security Testing</h2>
        <p>Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software...</p>

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>Evaluates the software’s user-friendliness.
            Assesses navigation, layout, and overall user experience.
            Helps improve user satisfaction.</p>

        <h2>Exploratory Testing</h2>
        <p>A manual approach where testers explore the application without predefined test scripts.
            Uncovers unexpected issues and provides valuable insights.
            Complements automated testing.</p>

        <h2>Smoke Testing</h2>
        <p>A quick check to verify if the critical functionalities work after code changes...</p>
